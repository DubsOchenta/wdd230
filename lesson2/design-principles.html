        <h4>
            The reason that I feel this website shows the use of Proximity is
            because of how the search bar, large coupon deals link, and the logo
            for the website are all close to eachother but are varying size and 
            distance from eachother.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Proximity Definition: The relationship between items on a page and site is
          critical for conveying a message and purpose to the user. Proximity
          deals with the placement of items and content on a page to establish
          the relative strength of a relationship between items.

        />
        <h4>
          Why I feel that this is a good example of Contrast is how the
          different elements of the site are layered. It has a hovering nav bar
          and a static header. both of these combine to create good contrast.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Contrast Definition: Contrast is designing a distinct difference between
          foreground and background colors in order to enhance readability.
          Contrast does not only deal with colors but also blends into visual
          hierarchy of font sizes, image placement, and content.

        <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>

        <img src="../images/www.google.com_tn.jpg" alt="Google Home Page" />
        <h4>
          The reason that I feel this is a good example for White Space is
          because it uses the white space efficiently to narrow you in on the
          most important part, the search bar and the Google logo.
        </h4>
        <p>
          White Space Definition- One of the biggest violations in beginning web design is
          the lack of proper white space, padding, and use of the space between
          elements of a design. This violation is seen on the page layout as a
          whole and with simple elements like the input elements on a form where
          there are natural and purposeful borders. We can enhance the user's
          experience with readability and increase comprehension of intent by
          using white space and appropriate padding between content and borders.
